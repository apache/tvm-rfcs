# Summary
[summary]: #summary

This is a follow-up of https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9727 and
[RFC#63](https://github.com/apache/tvm-rfcs/pull/63). Currently buffer can be implicitly
declared and then used. The implicit behavior can be error prone and makes analysis more difficult.
This RFC introduces `DeclBuffer`, a new IR construct as an explicit statement for buffer declaration.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Currently a Buffer object can be created and then referenced in TIR, without explicit declaration
or allocation. For example, in TVM script, one can use `T.buffer_decl` to create a new buffer and
then use it in the rest of the program.
```
@T.prim_func
def buffer_alias(A: T.Buffer[(16,), "float"]):
    A_vector = T.buffer_decl([4], "float32x4", data=A.data)
    T.evaluate(A_vector[0])  # read from buffer alias
```
However, `T.buffer_decl` doesnâ€™t translate to a node in AST. The AST will be
```
PrimFunc {
  buffer_map: {A_data: Buffer(data=A_data, ...)},
  body: Evaluate {
    BufferLoad {
      buffer: Buffer(data = A.data, [4], "float32x4")  # implicit creation of new buffer
      index: [0]
    }
  }
}
```
In this example, `BufferLoad` loads from an implicitly-created new buffer which aliases another
buffer. This example shows that a data variable can be used to create a buffer in arbitrary ways.
There are no guarantee that the created buffer and the underlying data variable have consistent
physical memory. This makes analysis in TIR difficult and error-prone as one should always check
whether a buffer in TIR is an implicitly-created one. 

By introducing explicit `DeclBuffer` statement, we can require that a buffer must always be declared
before any usages. This makes the creation and the usage of buffer better-managed within TIR.
Developers (e.g pass writers) can collect buffer information such as allocation, aliasing by
visiting `DeclBuffer` nodes.

# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

`DeclBuffer` will be defined as 
```
class DeclBuffer : public Stmt {
    Buffer buffer;  // the buffer declared
    Stmt body;  // the scope of the buffer
};
```

In TVM script, `T.buffer_decl` will be renamed to `T.decl_buffer` to make the name a verb phase that
is consistent with the existing ones such as `T.alloc_buffer`, `T.match_buffer`. `T.decl_buffer`
will be translated to a `DeclBuffer` object in TIR. This only changes the way parser handles
`T.decl_buffer`, the user API of `T.decl_buffer` in TVM script will stay the same.

In TIR, `DeclBuffer` will be handled in `StmtFunctor`. Visitors or mutators of `DeclBuffer` can be
override to handle `DeclBuffer` in TIR passes.

# Reference-level explanation
[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

## Allocation of intermediate buffer
The intermediate buffer inside `PrimFunc` can be declared and allocated in the following way:

```
Allocate {
  data: A_data{Var(data = ..., )},
  extent: ...,
  body: DeclBuffer {
    buffer: Buffer(data=A_data, dtype=..., shape=...),
    body: {
      ...
    }
  }
}
```
This can also be represented in TVMScript:
```
A_data = T.allocate(shape=..., dtype=...)
A = T.decl_buffer(data=A_data)
```

## Declaration of buffer alias
Buffer declared in `DeclBuffer` can reuse data variable from another buffer. This creates a buffer
alias.

```
DeclBuffer {
  buffer: A(data=Var(name=...), dtype=..., shape=...),
  body: {
    DeclBuffer {
      buffer: A_alias(data=A.data, ...)
      body: ...
    }
  }
}
```

## Replace `preflattened_buffer_map` with buffer alias

Currently, `PrimFunc` has two maps, `preflattened_buffer_map` and `buffer_map`, to specify the input
buffer shapes. Before the flattening passes (`FlattenBuffer` and `StorageFlatten`),
`preflattened_buffer_map` is empty and `buffer_map` contains the logical shapes of the buffers.
After flattening, the logical shapes are moved to `preflattened_buffer_map`, and `buffer_map` will
store the physical shapes of the buffers. The change of the information stored in `buffer_map` can
be confusing. These two maps can be unified into a single `buffer_map` that defines the logical
shapes of the input buffers. The buffer access in physical shape, which is an internal behavior of
`PrimFunc` after flattening, can be achieved by using `DeclBuffer` to create buffer aliases in
physical shapes.

This is illustrated in the example below.

Before flattening:
```
@T.prim_func
def elemwise(A: T.Buffer[(16, 16), "float32"], C: T.Buffer[(16, 16), "float32"]):
    for i, j in T.grid(16, 16):
        C[i, j] = A[i, j]
```

After flattening:
```
@T.prim_func
def elemwise(A: T.Buffer[(16, 16), "float32"], C: T.Buffer[(16, 16), "float32"]):
    A_flattened = T.decl_buffer(A.data, (256,), "float32")
    C_flattened = T.decl_buffer(C.data, (256,), "float32")
    for i, j in T.grid(16, 16):
        C_flattened[i * 16 + j] = A[i * 16 + j]
```

Specifically, the updated flow of buffer flattening using `DeclBuffer` will be:
1. Before `FlattenBuffer/StorageFlatten`: Buffers are declared in the `buffer_map`, and are not flattened. Buffer access is done using N-d unflattened indices.
2. After `FlattenBuffer/StorageFlatten`, but before `MakePackedAPI`: Buffers are declared in the `buffer_map`, and are not flattened. Buffer access is done through a buffer alias explicitly created via `DeclBuffer`, where the alias shares the same data pointer, but has a flattened shape and is accessed with flattened indices.
3. After `MakePackedAPI`: The `buffer_map` is empty. Necessary information such as shapes, strides, of the unflattened buffers, will become `AssertStmt` in the IR, but the unflattened buffers will be no longer accessible. Declarations of flattened buffers are done using the handles extracted using
`tvm_struct_get`. It will use explicit `DeclBuffer` to mark the use of the `T.handle` in the function parameters. These flattened buffers are accessed
with flattened indices.

## TVM script updates
* New statement `T.decl_buffer` will be introduced. It has the same interface as `T.buffer_decl`.
```python
def decl_buffer(
    shape: Sequence[Union[PrimExpr, int]],
    dtype: str = "float32",
    data: Var = None,
    strides: Optional[Sequence[int]] = None,
    elem_offset: Optional[int] = None,
    scope: str = "global",
    align: int = -1,
    offset_factor: int = 0,
    buffer_type: str = "default",
    axis_separators: Optional[List[int]] = None,
) -> Buffer: ...
```
It will be parsed to `DeclBuffer` node.

* `T.allocate` will return data variable instead of a buffer. If the subsequent program need to access
the data variable as a buffer, it should use `T.decl_buffer` to declare the buffer.
* As a syntax sugar to avoid writing both `T.allocate` and `T.decl_buffer` at the same time,
when the `data` parameter is not specified for `T.decl_buffer`, the buffer data will be
allocated implicitly. This means the following code snippets are equivalent:
```
A_data = T.allocate(shape=[16], dtype="float32")
A = T.decl_buffer(shape=[16], dtype="float32", data=A_data)
```
```
A = T.decl_buffer(shape=[16], dtype="float32")
```
* `T.buffer_decl` will be deprecated in favor of the explicit `T.decl_buffer`.

## TIR validation
With `DeclBuffer` introduced, we can implement utilities for TIR validation. It will enforce that:
* No implicit buffer declaration. In lowered TIR, buffers must be defined explicitly via `DeclBuffer`.
* No undefined buffer. Buffer in `DeclBuffer` must have been allocated, that is, the data variable
of the buffer must be from the function parameters, `AllocateNode`, alias of other buffers, or from
the return value of other functions (*).

(*) Note: After `MakePackedAPI`, the backing buffers are the return value of `@tir.tvm_struct_get`. 
It could also be an entirely separate function call, such as `data: T.Ptr[T.int32] = T.call_extern("device_specific_malloc", 1024, dtype="handle")`.
## Engineering plan
This RFC introduces a TIR change that may require significant refactor to the existing codebase.
It can be decomposed into three parts to reduce a pull request size.

- Part 1: Introduce `DeclBuffer` data structure, add corresponding visitors in IR functors.
- Part 2: Refactor existing passes and test cases to use `DeclBuffer`.
- Part 3: Enforce the usage of `DeclBuffer`. No implicit buffer declarations are allowed.

# Rationale and alternatives
In S-TIR, there is an alternative to define buffer declarations inside the block, similar to the
existing alloc_buffers, match_buffers:

```
class Block : public Stmt {
  /*! \brief The buffer allocated in the block. */
  Array<Buffer> alloc_buffers;
  /*! \brief The match buffer regions. */
  Array<MatchBufferRegion> match_buffers;
  /*! \brief The buffer declared in the block. */
  Array<Buffer> decl_buffers;
};
```
This unifies the scope of `DeclBuffer` with the block scope. In low-level TIR, a `DeclBuffer`
statement is still needed because Block is not available in low-level TIR. This is similar to the
current status that `block->alloc_buffers` is lowered to Allocate. For now since there are no needs
of `DeclBuffer` during TIR scheduling, we would like to avoid introducing `block->decl_buffers` to
keep it simple. It can be an incremental work upon this when future needs come up.

Another option would be to separate the concepts of memory allocation and buffer access.
A memory allocation would represent the allocation of some number of bytes, and would always use
physical shape. Each buffer would have a backing allocation, and would represent access into some
tensor, and would use logical/transformed shape. Overall, it would be the difference between having
one "real" buffer and multiple aliases, as opposed to having several buffers, and a memory
allocation backing them, emphasizing that thereâ€™s nothing special about the first buffer. We decided
this isnâ€™t necessary, because it would add way more boilerplate for the most common case of one
buffer, and would encourage people to make buffer aliases when not necessary.

# Drawbacks
The scope of the buffer in `DeclBuffer` is declared as `body` field. It adds level of recursion in
TIR visitors. Since the number of buffers declared inside a `PrimFunc` is usually small, this is
unlikely a concern.

# Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

Buffer declaration is implicitly supported prior to this RFC. In TVM script, `T.buffer_decl` is used
to declare a buffer, which can be in other TIR expressions and/or statements. This RFC is intended
to formalize this process by using explicit `DeclBuffer` statement.

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

Should low-level code generators handle buffer aliases?  One option would be to remove them in a
lowering pass.  Another option would be to use them to represent explicit type casts, rather than
having any implicit typecasts.

When `DeclBuffer` creates a buffer alias, what are the requirements (`shape`, `dtype`,
`elem_offset`, etc.) of the aliasing buffer? The current behavior of the implicit buffer aliasing
is to assume the aliasing buffer is valid, and rely on codegen to handle buffer aliases.

# Future possibilities
[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

With explicit `DeclBuffer` statement in TIR, we can introduce analysis passes for buffer aliasing.
This will help the existing TIR passes to explicitly examine whether their assumption on buffer
aliasing are satisfied.

After this RFC, in the lowered TIR, we need to use two separate statements, `T.allocate` and `T.decl_buffer` to allocate a buffer data pointer and then declare the buffer. In the future, we can consider providing syntax sugar to allow `T.allocate` to return a buffer. This would require some investigation how we should achieve TVMScript - TIR bidirectional translation.
