## 1. Summary

This proposal introduces Meta Schedule: a scheduling DSL on TIR that unifies the
approaches of AutoTVM [1] and AutoScheduler [2]. Meta schedule provides a pragmatic way to define
the space of automatic tuning, extensibility in terms of all possible TIR schedule primitives like
tensorization and loop partitioning, and customizability on every layer of the automation system.

Meta Schedule is the 3rd generation automatic scheduling system.

## 2. Motivation

**Scheduling.**
In TVM, computation of each operator is described
by either Tensor Expression (TE, the prior standard) or
[TensorIR](https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/rfc-tensorir-a-schedulable-ir-for-tvm/7872) (TIR).
Through a process known as **scheduling**,
TVM allows a pre-defined set of transformations over these IRs,
either lazily (transforms by manipulating the schedule tree)
or eagerly (transforms by manipulating TIR),
so that the end IRs could be lowered to code with potentially better performance.
Such transformations are guided by a developer-provided program,
which consist of this pre-defined set of transformations,
called **schedule primitives**.

**Design space.** The set of all possible schedulings of a TE/TensorIR is called its design space.
Optimization in TVM is essentially exploring such space to find out a scheduling that transforms the
IR to generate the kernel with optimal performance.

### Problems with the current scheduling system

Currently there are 3 sets of scheduling APIs in TVM:
* **Manual schedule**: Developers optimize their programs by manually invoking schedule primitives,
  i.e. explore points in the design space with humans in the loop. This can be a tedious and
  error-prone approach, hence the creation of AutoTVM and AutoScheduler.
* **AutoTVM**: The automation system requires users to define the design space through
  per-operator "schedule templates." Therefore, programmer time is a bottleneck in scaling
  to hundreds of operators across many hardware platforms.
  hardware platforms.
* **AutoScheduler**: It automatically generates schedule templates as the design space,
  according to a set of predefined "search rules". However, it is non-trivial to extend
  AutoScheduler to new schedule primitives (tensorize, loop partition, software pipelining, etc).
* The three systems above have isolated sets of APIs with several layers of their own abstraction,
  which are not only hard to learn, but also engineering-intensive to customize.

### Benefits of Meta Schedule

The existing three scheduling systems are mutually incompatible with each other in terms of API
design and divergence: besides manual TE scheduling, AutoTVM requires users to learn a new set of
APIs, and AutoScheduler brings in another set of C++-based search rules. It adds the users' mental
overhead to understand and extend the existing systems. Further, the inability to switch between
template-based and template-free auto-tuning could lead to inferior customizability and hence
make it needlessly difficult to achieve optimal performance.

Meta schedule provides:
* Succinct syntax, consistent APIs to TensorIR schedule with no other layer of abstraction.
* Unified APIs for implementing manual schedules, AutoTVM-style schedules, and AutoScheduler-style
  schedules.
* Extensibility of all the schedule primitives, including tensorization and loop partitioning.
  Almost no extra effort is needed to use a new primitive in auto-tuning.
* The automation infrastructure is extensible on every of its components. Every component of the
  system can be customized easily in pure python or C++ or both. For example, one can develop a new
  design space generator in python, a new ProgramRunner in python, etc.


## 3. Guide-level explanation

Meta Schedule DSL is a language that provides TVM backend developers
a flexible way to define or auto-generate the operator design space.

This section introduces the syntax of Meta Schedule DSL by describing the 5 common usage patterns
envisioned by this RFC. These patterns are:
1) Manually constructing a schedule using existing schedule primitives (Section 3.1);
2) Defining composite schedule to simplify the ap sequence of schedule primitives (Section 3.2);
3) Describing a design space of possible schedules,
a.k.a. AutoTVM-style schedule templates (Section 3.3);
4) Automatically generating the design space, a.k.a. AutoScheduler-style search rules (Section 3.4);
5) Mixing the usage of manual schedule, AutoTVM and AutoScheduler-style design space specification
in Meta Schedule (Section 3.5).

### 3.1. Manual Schedule

Meta schedule APIs are almost the same as TE or TensorIR scheduling. Here is an example of a manual
schedule for matrix multiplication:

```python
# Designate a set of tile sizes
i_tiles = [16, 8, 8, 8]
j_tiles = [16, 8, 8, 8]
k_tiles = [256, 8]

# Tile the loops according to the tile sizes
i_0, i_1, i_2, i_3 = sch.split(loop=i, factors=i_tiles)
j_0, j_1, j_2, j_3 = sch.split(loop=j, factors=j_tiles)
k_0, k_1           = sch.split(loop=k, factors=k_tiles)

# Organize the loops into "SSRSRS" 6-level tiles
sch.reorder(
    i_0, j_0, # S: the 1st spatial tile
    i_1, j_1, # S: the 2nd spatial tile
    k_0,      # R: the 1st reduction tile
    i_2, j_2, # S: the 3rd spatial tile
    k_1,      # R: the 2nd reduction tile
    i_3, j_3, # S: the 4th spatial tile
)
```

In this manual scheduling example, the developers tweak the tile sizes and measure the performance of the
generated kernels to explore the opportunities of potential optimization.

Generally speaking, while writing a schedule, there are often some parameters that are hard to
determine ahead of time, for example, tile sizes, unroll steps, or which tensor intrinsics to use.
Developers may manually enumerate possible combinations of these unknown factors, and then pick the
best schedule according to measurement results on their device.

### 3.2. Composite Schedule Rules

As introduced in the previous section, in TensorIR, each schedule primitive handles only a very
basic transformation of the IR. For example, `split` only splits a loop into two new loops. In the
real world, the over-fine granularity of those primitives usually leads to repetitive and verbose
scheduling code. Take the code snippet in the previous section as an example: a sequence of `split`s
are invoked, followed by a `reorder`. Taken together these 4 primitives are colloquially known as
"SSRSRS" tiling.

To make it more convenient and modular, users are allowed to register **composite schedules** that apply
a sequence of schedule primitives according to certain analysis of the IR.
The word **composite** here means the schedule transformation is *composed* of those **primitives**.

For example, suppose there is a composite schedule called `Inline-Elementwise-Operation`, which
inlines elementwise computation into their consumers if possible. Applying it to the
following TensorIR:

```python
@tvm.script.tir
def example_func(...):
  for i, j in ...:
    with tir.Block("B") ...:
      B[i, j] = A[i, j] + 1
  for i, j in ...:
    with tir.Block("C") ...:
      C[i, j] = B[i, j] + 1
  for i, j in ...:
    with tir.Block("D") ...:
      D[i, j] = C[i, j] + 1

sch = tir.Schedule(example_func)
# `InlineElementwiseOperation` is a composite schedule rule that analyzes a given block.
# If the block contains only elementwise computation, and can be inlined into its consumer,
# then `sch.compute_inline` is called on that block.
inliner = InlineElementwiseOperation()
inliner.apply(schedule=sch, block=sch.get_block("B"))
inliner.apply(schedule=sch, block=sch.get_block("C"))
inliner.apply(schedule=sch, block=sch.get_block("D"))
```

Below is the result after applying this composite schedule, and its corresponding trace:

```python

>>> print(tvm.script.asscript(sch.mod))
@tvm.script.tir
def example_func(...):
  for i, j in ...:
    with tir.Block("D") ...:
      D[i, j] = A[i, j] + 1 + 1 + 1

>>> print(sch.trace)
# Block "B" is elementwise and inlinable, then `sch.compute_inline(B)` is called
B = sch.get_block("B")
sch.compute_inline(B)
# Block "C" is elementwise and inlinable, then `sch.compute_inline(C)` is called
C = sch.get_block("C")
sch.compute_inline(C)
# Block "D" is elementwise but does not have a consumer,
# so the rule does not call `compute_inline` because it is not inlinable
D = sch.get_block("D")
```

### 3.3. AutoTVM-style Design Space Description

Meta schedule extends the schedule DSL with a set of new schedule primitives
called **sampling instructions**. These primitives do not transform the TensorIR,
but instead introduce random statistical variables which can be referenced later in scheduling
to parameterize the schedule. Incorporating **sampling instructions** into a operator's schedule
allows the backend developers to succinctly describe a design space in terms of
tiling strategies, fusion levels, unroll lengths, etc.

The matmul example above is extended to cover all possible tilings using these sampling
instructions:

```python
# Sample tile sizes
i_tiles = sch.sample_perfect_tile(i, n=4)  # was: i_tiles = [16, 8, 8, 8]
j_tiles = sch.sample_perfect_tile(j, n=4)  # was: j_tiles = [16, 8, 8, 8]
k_tiles = sch.sample_perfect_tile(k, n=2)  # was: k_tiles = [256, 8]
# Tile the loops according to the random variables
i_0, i_1, i_2, i_3 = sch.split(loop=i, factors=i_tiles)
j_0, j_1, j_2, j_3 = sch.split(loop=j, factors=j_tiles)
k_0, k_1           = sch.split(loop=k, factors=k_tiles)
# Organize the loops into "SSRSRS" 6-level tiles
sch.reorder(
    i_0, j_0, # S: the 1st spatial tile
    i_1, j_1, # S: the 2nd spatial tile
    k_0,      # R: the 1st reduction tile
    i_2, j_2, # S: the 3rd spatial tile
    k_1,      # R: the 2nd reduction tile
    i_3, j_3, # S: the 4th spatial tile
)
```

### 3.4. AutoScheduler-style Design Space Generation

To generate design space, AutoScheduler applies a set of rules to each
[TE stage](https://tvm.apache.org/docs/api/python/te.html#tvm.te.Stage) that corresponds to a
[TE operation](https://tvm.apache.org/docs/api/doxygen/classtvm_1_1te_1_1Operation.html),
defined by [`te.compute(...)`](https://tvm.apache.org/docs/api/python/te.html#tvm.te.compute).
The rules analyze the TE operations and apply an [internal DSL]() to manipulating its internal IR,
which is in the end mapped to TE schedule primitives. This process is called *sketch generation*.

Composite schedule rules work in a similar way scheduling TensorIR, as introduced in Section 3.2.
It analyzes the TensorIR and apply schedule primitives directly to TensorIR accordingly.
When applying such rules to each TensorIR block in certain order (Post-DFS is provided as the
builtin order, but customization is allowed),
it generates a sequence of schedule primitives.
This process corresponds to the *sketch generation* phase in AutoScheduler.
If sampling instructions are present in this sequence,
then a design space is defined by those instructions for the meta schedule to explore.
This process is similar to the *random annotation* phase in AutoScheduler.

Several built-in composite schedule rules are shipped with meta schedule to align with the design
space generated by AutoScheduler:

* Multi-level tiling
* Inline pure spatial blocks
* Parallelize & vectorize & unroll
* Auto tensorize

Developers may implement their own rules in either Python or C++. They may specify which rules to
use with the following syntax:

```python
from tvm import meta_schedule as ms

design_space_generator = ms.PostOrderApply(rules=[
    ms.MultiLevelTiling(...),
    CustomRule(...),
    ms.OtherBuiltinRules(...),
])

```

### 3.5. Unifying manual schedule / AutoTVM / AutoScheduler

This subsection shows that the design space induced by TE manual schedule, AutoTVM and AutoScheduler
are all subsets of meta schedule, and meta schedule further allows mixing those three styles to
search jointly.

- **Manual schedule**. The TE schedule is a special case of a meta schedule program, where there is no
randomness introduced by sampling instructions. It is a single point in terms of design space.
- **AutoTVM (Template-based tuning)**. It is more natural representation of AutoTVM’s schedule
templates (knobs) by writing one or more schedule functions in meta schedule with sampling
instructions. The probability space supported by the sampling instructions is the design space to
be explored.
- **AutoScheduler (Template-free tuning)**. As mentioned in the previous section, application
  of composite schedule rules generates the design space, which is equivalent to AutoScheduler’s
  sketch generation.
- **Mixing styles in design space definition**. By taking union of the spaces induced by the three
  special cases, meta schedule allows developers to combine generic rules that AutoScheduler
  provides and operator-specific scheduling.

## 4. Reference-level explanation

This section introduces the underlying techniques for the automation system to extract and
explore the design space. The figure below briefly illustrates the workflow of the system:

![meta-schedule-workflow](../resources/meta-schedule-workflow.png)

### 4.1. Execution trace as the design space

**Trace**. To represent the design space defined by the meta schedule DSL, the underlying system
records all the instructions users applied to the schedule class, including sampling and schedule
primitives. This list of scheduling instructions being invoked, along with the random decisions made
on sampling instructions, is called a trace.

For instance, executing the example above results in the following trace:

```
Instruction 0. Sample-Perfect-Tile
Instruction 1. Sample-Perfect-Tile
Instruction 2. Sample-Perfect-Tile
Instruction 3. Split
Instruction 4. Split
Instruction 5. Split
Instruction 6. Reorder
```

**Trace forms design space.** A trace may contain zero or more sampling instructions, which
introduces the uncertainty in scheduling - one instance of sampling results in one point in the
design space. Therefore, the trace itself forms a design space to explore, e.g. which set of tile
sizes works best on a specific hardware.

**Union of design space**. Meta schedule works on a set of traces, representing the union of the design
spaces represented by every single trace.

**Fork a trace**. When two different decisions in the scheduling process are equally important to
generate high-performance schedules, it is allowed to fork the trace into two, and the design space is
the union of the forked traces.

The trace is not strictly user-facing, but can be accessed and printed with the following syntax:

```python
# requires to trace the execution
sch = tir.Schedule(..., traced=True)
# do a lot of scheduling
...
# print the trace
print(sch.trace)
```

And below is an example of the printed trace, which honestly reflects the schedule as a snippet of
python scheduling function:

```python
b0 = sch.get_block(name="matmul", func_name="main")
l1, l2, l3 = sch.get_loops(block=b0)
v4, v5, v6, v7 = sch.sample_perfect_tile(loop=l1, n=4, max_innermost_factor=16, decision=[32, 1, 16, 2])
v8, v9, v10, v11 = sch.sample_perfect_tile(loop=l2, n=4, max_innermost_factor=16, decision=[64, 4, 2, 2])
v12, v13 = sch.sample_perfect_tile(loop=l3, n=2, max_innermost_factor=16, decision=[64, 16])
l14, l15, l16, l17 = sch.split(loop=l1, factors=[v4, v5, v6, v7])
l18, l19, l20, l21 = sch.split(loop=l2, factors=[v8, v9, v10, v11])
l22, l23 = sch.split(loop=l3, factors=[v12, v13])
sch.reorder(l14, l18, l15, l19, l22, l16, l20, l23, l17, l21)
```

**Implementation.** A trace is defined as:

```python
class Trace:
  instructions: List[Instruction]
  decisions: Dict[Instruction, Any]
```

For each sampling instruction in the trace, if it has a corresponding entry in the decisions dict,
then the output is uniquely determined by the decision, hence reproducibility is guaranteed
(Example 1); If a corresponding entry is not presented, then randomness will be introduced by
interpreting the trace (Example 2).

```python
# Example 1. Trace with deterministic result
l1, l2 = sch.sample_perfect_tile(loop, n=2, decisions=[4, 32])  # Deterministic l1 = 4, l2 = 32
# Example 2. Trace with randomized result
l1, l2 = sch.sample_perfect_tile(loop, n=2)  # l1 and l2 are random
```

### 4.2. Exploring the Design Space

Meta Schedule provides several built-in exploration strategies to exhaustively or efficiently search
for efficient schedules. Those strategies are mostly supported by re-execute either a function or a
trace with a builtin interpreter in meta schedule, and this process is called **replay**.

#### Random search by replaying schedule functions

With a user-provided schedule function
as a black-box design space generator, meta schedule repetitively invokes such an opaque TVM
packed function without doing any extra analysis.
If sampling instructions are present in the trace, then scheduling is non-deterministic
(random decisions may not be repeated across runs)
Effectively, it is equivalent to random exploration without trace,
allowing the flexibility for users to define arbitrary functions
that trace may not well support (e.g. control flow divergence based on the value of intermediate
random variables), but it forbids future opportunity of any trace-based analysis.

#### Random search by replaying traces

A builtin interpreter directly replays the traces obtained
from manual schedule, template-based or template-free design space generation.
If sampling instructions are present in the traces,
then their random decisions are mutated during each replay, i.e. jumps to a new point in the
design space. Therefore, repetitive replay of those traces are equivalent to exploration of the
design space.

The search speed of meta schedule could be improved by allowing traces to be analyzed before they
are run. For example, trace analysis could reject obviously-invalid schedules (e.g. using too many
CUDA resource), remove dead-code before they are run. The cost model could benefit from the traces
as well by extracting trace-level features.

#### Cost-model-guided evolutionary search

A more efficient exploration strategy introduced by AutoScheduler.
For more details, please refer to Section 5.1 of its paper [2].

The evolutionary search strategy requires two sets of rule-specific logic to execute to
either validate or tweak the produced schedule:

* Mutator: defines how to jump to a point’s "neighbor" in the design space
* Postprocessor: after the trace is executed, there are some extra rules to execute, for
  example:
  * Check CUDA resource limits: There is a hard requirement in CUDA that the maximum number of
    threads should not exceed 1024, but it is a random variable that cannot be determined before
    actually executing the trace. In this case, a postprocessor is implemented to error out when
    such conditions are not satisfied.
  * Fuse outer loops until the extent of the fused loops is large enough: The number of outer loops
    to be fused together depends on their extents, which are random variables. In this case, the
    composite schedule rule annotates the maximum extent allowed on the block, and a corresponding
    postprocessor detects the annotation and does the actual fusion.

The evolutionary search algorithm uses mutators to find possible schedules in the design space, then
applies postprocessors and asks the cost model to predict its performance. After a few
iterations, the new schedules with the highest scores are finally compiled and measured on device.
Epsilon-greedy is used in this process to balance exploitation and exploration.

### 4.3. Database

All the measure records are serialized and stored in a database. The schema of the database has the
following information:

- The workload, a serialized TensorIR;
- The hardware target where the measure is conducted;
- Argument type: the shapes and dtypes of the input tensors fed to the measured PrimFunc.
This field can be useful for future dynamic-shape workloads;
- The trace, including the schedule primitives used and their corresponding decisions (if any);
- The measured running time;
- The version of the log.

### 4.4. Python-first for flexibility & customizability

The system is implemented in a way that all levels are decoupled and open to customization, aiming
at providing a playground for developers to try out new ideas and potentially deliver performance
quickly.

While all the important APIs are implemented in C++ for efficiency, every part of the system can be
easily switched to customized python implementation. For example,

#### Customize design space in python

The design space can be defined as a python function

```python
def schedule_matmul(sch) -> sch:
    i, j, k = sch.get_loops(sch.get_block("matmul"))
    i_tiles = sch.sample_perfect_tile(i, n=4)
    j_tiles = sch.sample_perfect_tile(j, n=4)
    k_tiles = sch.sample_perfect_tile(k, n=2)
    # Tile the loops according to the random variables
    i_0, i_1, i_2, i_3 = sch.split(loop=i, factors=i_tiles)
    j_0, j_1, j_2, j_3 = sch.split(loop=j, factors=j_tiles)
    k_0, k_1 = sch.split(loop=k, factors=k_tiles)
    # Organize the loops into "SSRSRS" 6-level tiles
    sch.reorder(
        i_0, j_0, # S
        i_1, j_1, # S
        k_0,      # R
        i_2, j_2, # S
        k_1,      # R
        i_3, j_3, # S
    )
    return sch
```

#### Customize composite schedule in python

The system provides two interfaces to define a composite schedule in python, one is more succinct,
and the other is more comprehensive:

Method 1. Derive from `PyCompositeSchedule`, and implement two methods `initialize` and `apply`:

```python
class MultiLevelTiling(PyCompositeSchedule):
    def initialize(...):
        # initialize the class, usually this method is empty
        ...

    def apply(sch: Schedule, block: BlockRV) -> Union[Schedule, List[Schedule]]:
        # write any python code, including:
        # - analyze `block`
        # - invoke schedule primitives in `sch`
        # - do debug printing
        ...
```

Method 2. A decorator as the syntactic sugar if the `initialize` method is empty, which converts the
function to the `apply` method.

```python
@tir.as_composite_schedule(name="multi-level-tiling")
def multi_level_tiling(sch: Schedule, block: BlockRV) -> Union[Schedule, List[Schedule]]:
    # write any python code, including:
    # - analyze `block`
    # - invoke schedule primitives in `sch`
    # - do debug printing
    ...
```

#### Customize exploration strategies in python

Developers can implement any search algorithm in python as well by deriving from `PySearchPolicy`,
and the syntax is identical to customizing with `PyCompositeSchedule`.

#### Other customizable components

This list includes:

* Cost model
* Database
* Measure callbacks
* Feature extractor
* Program builder & runner
* Analysis methods
* ...

In a short summary, almost every component of the system is decoupled with each other and extensions
could be easily plugged in.

## 5. Drawbacks

Meta schedule requires integration with Relay operator strategy and compile engine (TECompiler) to
properly lower a Relay subgraph for task extraction. Further, TE schedules in TOPI will need to be
migrated to TensorIR schedules.

## 6. Rationale and alternatives

The system is designed with the principle of minimalism: Assuming users already know TensorIR
scheduling APIs, there is no more extra API set to learn; The previous programs that schedules
TensorIR still work out of box with the meta schedule DSL. It could potentially lower the bar of
adopting this system.

Unifying manual scheduling, AutoTVM's semi automatic templates and AutoScheduler's fully automatic
sketch generation provides flexible way to balance injection new domain knowledge and automation.

Flexibility in customization allows quick try-out on new tasks, new strategies and new hardware
targets without deep knowledge of the system.

## 7. Prior art

**Tensor Expression (TE)** in TVM is a DSL that decouples compute and schedule, which provides
convenient ways to handcraft optimized kernels for different hardware targets.

**TensorIR** is the low-level IR in TVM. Its capability of eagerly applying schedule primitives
opens the door for meta schedule, the proposed next-generation auto scheduling system.

**AutoTVM** is the 1st generation automation framework in TVM, which requires developers to
implement per-operator scheduling templates, and the system could handle the tuning process.

**AutoScheduler** is the 2nd generation automation framework in TVM, whose built-in rules
could automatically generate schedule templates for almost all the operators on CPU, GPU, etc.

## 8. Unresolved questions

**Control Flow**

The meta schedule DSL does not support control flow yet. Although there is no report of
real-world use case at the time of writing, it is possible that it could appear in some future
workloads. The best syntax of the control flow is not determined yet, but a working example could be
TensorFlow's `tf.cond`.

**Assertion**

Sampling instructions may lead to wrong schedules on CUDA, e.g. the resulting program uses too much
shared memory, too many threads, etc. It is detected by a postprocessor. To accelerate the process,
it is possible to introduce an assertion statement that exits early if the GPU code is not valid,
and its syntax can be, for example:

```python
sch.assert(j_2 * j_2 <= 1024)
```

## 9. Future possibilities

**Unifying Manual Scheduling, AutoTVM and AutoScheduler in TOPI**

As described in Section 3.5, meta schedule provides an idiomatic approach to unify the three
existing scheduling APIs in TVM:

* Manual schedules are meta schedules without sampling instructions;
* AutoTVM templates are meta schedules where knobs are replaced by sampling instructions;
* Each of AutoScheduler’s search rules generates a snippet of a meta schedule;
* Mixture of the above three approaches to cover larger design space.

At the time of writing, TOPI contains a number of schedule functions implemented either in manual TE
or AutoTVM-style. It is our future work to unify these existing scheduling APIs on TOPI operators,
and enable different styles to be auto-tuned jointly.
